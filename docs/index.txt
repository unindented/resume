Experience

Apr 2021 – Present

    Staff Software Engineer at Twitter (Seattle, WA)

    I led the web implementation of Super Follows, a paid monthly
    subscription that offers access to exclusive content from eligible
    creators.

    -   Developed the application, onboarding, and management flows that
        allowed users to become Super Follows creators, and manage their
        offerings, using Flow, React, Relay, and GraphQL.
    -   Developed the subscription payment flow, backed by Stripe.
    -   Onboarded and mentored three other web engineers on the team.
    -   Contributed to the wider Twitter web community by educating
        other engineers on Relay, leading postmortems, improving and
        rewriting unit tests using React Testing Library, and helping
        with accessibility audits, among other things.

Dec 2018 – Apr 2021

    Principal Software Engineer at Microsoft (Redmond, WA)

    I led the rewrite of Yammer’s web client (a.k.a. New Yammer), using
    TypeScript, React, Redux, and GraphQL.

    -   The visual refresh, coupled with new features and integrations
        that addressed top customer needs, garnered a lot of positive
        press, and boosted engagement metrics.
    -   Scaled the codebase to 30+ engineers with different skill
        levels.
    -   Maintained quality through tooling, using Jest, ESLint, and
        Puppeteer.

Feb 2017 – Dec 2018

    Senior Software Engineer at Microsoft (Redmond, WA)

    I relocated to Microsoft’s offices in Redmond, but kept working on
    Yammer’s main web client.

    -   Worked on migrating the codebase from legacy technologies like
        jQuery and Backbone, to React and Redux, in order to improve
        developer productivity and happiness.
    -   Developed Yammer’s desktop client from scratch, using Electron
        and TypeScript.
    -   Pitched a rewrite of Yammer’s web client, with documents
        explaining the new architecture and the general plan we’d
        follow. Senior leadership accepted the proposal, and staffed it
        with me as lead engineer.

Oct 2012 – Feb 2017

    Senior Software Development Engineer at Microsoft (London, UK)

    After the acquisition by Microsoft, I kept working on Yammer’s main
    web client, developing features and improving the maintainability of
    the ~220KLOC front-end codebase.

    -   Helped introduce peer-reviewed pull requests into the workflow,
        improving communication among developers, and progressively
        reducing technical debt.
    -   Migrated a four-thousand-line custom build process to Webpack,
        reducing maintenance costs, and allowing for the introduction of
        productivity-enhancing tools like TypeScript.
    -   Prototyped a desktop client that wrapped the original web
        client, using Electron.
    -   Prototyped an alternative web client, using React and Redux.
    -   Prototyped alternative iOS and Android clients that shared 90%
        of their code, using React Native.
    -   Gave internal talks on various topics, including React, Redux
        and Webpack.

Jul 2012 – Oct 2012

    Software Development Engineer II at Yammer (London, UK)

    Yammer is an enterprise social network. As an early hire for their
    London offices, I worked on the development of Yammer’s main web
    client, a single-page app built on top of a Ruby on Rails
    application.

    -   Led the development of key features, collaborating with product
        managers, designers, front-end and back-end engineers, and data
        analysts.
    -   Shipped projects and measured their impact on user engagement
        and other metrics, making heavy use of feature flags and A/B
        testing.
    -   Started the migration from an undocumented and untested internal
        MVC framework to Backbone, speeding up development, and making
        onboarding of new hires much easier.
    -   Improved the quality and consistency of the front-end codebase
        through linting (JSHint) and unit testing (Jasmine).
