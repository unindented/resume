        surfaces, focused on helping users understand and optimize SQL

    TypeScript, React, Redux, and GraphQL.

    -   The visual refresh, coupled with new features and integrations
        that addressed top customer needs, garnered a lot of positive

    Senior Software Engineer at Microsoft (Redmond, WA)

    I relocated to Microsoft’s offices in Redmond, but kept working on
    Yammer’s main web client.

    -   Worked on migrating the codebase from legacy technologies like
        jQuery and Backbone, to React and Redux, in order to improve
        developer productivity and happiness.

        and TypeScript.
    -   Pitched a rewrite of Yammer’s web client, with documents

Oct 2012 – Feb 2017

    Senior Software Development Engineer at Microsoft (London, UK)

    After the acquisition by Microsoft, I kept working on Yammer’s main

    the ~220KLOC front-end codebase.

    -   Helped introduce peer-reviewed pull requests into the workflow,
        improving communication among developers, and progressively
        reducing technical debt.
    -   Migrated a four-thousand-line custom build process to Webpack,
        reducing maintenance costs, and allowing for the introduction of
        productivity-enhancing tools like TypeScript.
